## Technologies Used

This project leverages several modern technologies to provide a seamless and
dynamic user experience:

- **Svelte 4**: Core framework used to build the application, ensuring fast and
  reactive interfaces;
- **Runes**: Extends Svelte with additional capabilities for state and logic
  management;
- **ShadCN**: Provides pre-built, customizable UI components for a polished user
  interface;
- **MapLibre** and **MapTiler**: Used for rendering interactive maps and
  managing map data; and
- **Tailwind CSS**: Enables rapid and consistent styling with a utility-first
  CSS framework.

## Future Enhancements

Looking ahead, I can introduce the following features to further enhance the
functionality of the application:

- **Google Maps API Integration**: Utilize the Google Maps API to dynamically
  fetch and display time and location-specific data, ensuring up-to-date and
  accurate information; and
- **User Notifications**: Allow users to select specific locations and receive
  notifications about their opening or closing times, enhancing the utility of
  the platform.
